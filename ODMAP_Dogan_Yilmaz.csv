"Overview","Hypotheses","Hypotheses","The hypotheses about species-environment relationships are centered on the idea that the distribution of sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) is primarily governed by a combination of macroclimatic and micro-scale environmental factors. At the national scale, the distribution is believed to be shaped by broad climatic variables, such as temperature seasonality, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, annual precipitation, and precipitation seasonality. At a more local, regional scale, the hypothesis is that microhabitat variability plays a crucial role. This is captured by specific topographic and hydrological variables, including Direct Insolation, Slope, Minimal Curvature, and Vertical Distance to Channel Network. The study's multi-scale, hierarchical modeling approach is designed to test these hypotheses by integrating both macroclimatic and fine-scale landscape features, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of how these different environmental gradients collectively influence the species' distribution."
"Overview","Assumptions","Model assumptions","Critical model assumptions are that the species is in equilibrium with its environment, meaning its current distribution reflects the present-day environmental conditions. It is also assumed that the chosen predictor variables accurately represent the key drivers of the species' distribution. Finally, and most critically for future predictions, the models assume that the species-environment relationships are stable and will not change over time, and that these relationships are transferable across different geographical regions."

"Overview","Algorithms","Model complexity","The justification for the model complexity in the thesis is based on the multi-scale nature of the species' distribution. The core reasoning is that while broad-scale climatic factors are fundamental to defining the overall range of a species, they are insufficient to accurately predict its distribution at a local or regional level. Therefore, a more complex, hierarchical modeling approach was justified to integrate both macroclimatic and micro-scale environmental variables. This allowed the models to capture fine-scale habitat variations that are critical for species' survival and persistence, such as topographic and hydrological features, which are not accounted for in coarser, national-scale models. By using this multi-scale approach, the study aimed to create a more robust and realistic prediction of the species' current and future habitat suitability."
"Overview","Algorithms","Model averaging","Model averaging and ensemble modeling were key components of the workflow, utilized to enhance the robustness and reliability of predictions by mitigating the inherent biases of single algorithms. This approach was implemented using the biomod2 R package, specifically through the EMmean function. The process involved fitting multiple individual models (e.g., Random Forest, Generalized Boosted Models, Generalized Linear Models) and then selecting only those that met a minimum performance threshold, specifically a TSS (True Skill Statistic) value greater than 0.75. The final ensemble models were then created by combining the outputs of these selected models using the EMmean function to produce an averaged prediction. The document notes that this method consistently resulted in higher validation metrics and a reduction in spatial prediction variance compared to relying on a single model."
"Overview","Workflow","Model workflow","The modeling workflow in the thesis was a four-step process. First, data preparation involved using the spThin R package to reduce sampling bias in species occurrence data and the usdm R package to remove multicollinearity from environmental variables, ensuring that a robust set of predictor variables was selected. Second, in the model fitting stage, the biomod2 R package served as the core platform. It was used to fit an ensemble of individual species distribution models, including GLM,, GBM and RF. To ensure the models were not spatially autocorrelated, the blockCV R package was used to partition the data into spatial folds for cross-validation. Third, the model assessment was performed by evaluating the individual models using metrics such as the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Finally, for prediction, the top-performing individual models were combined into a final ensemble model, which was then used to project the current and future potential distribution of sweet chestnut under various climate change scenarios.

The regional-scale workflow was a nested, two-step process that built upon the national-scale models. First, the national-scale climate data was downscaled from 1 km to 120 m resolution using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to create a high-resolution Climatic SDM. The habitat suitability output from this downscaled climatic model was then used as a predictor variable alongside four high-resolution topographic and hydrological variables (Direct Insolation, Slope, Minimal Curvature, and Vertical Distance to Channel Network), which were derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using SAGA GIS. The resulting hierarchical models were then assessed for performance and predictive accuracy, likely using metrics such as TSS and AUC, before a final ensemble model was created from the best-performing models. This final ensemble was then used to make predictions of the species' potential distribution at the regional scale, incorporating both broad climatic influences and fine-scale, regional landscape features."

"Data","Biodiversity data","Background data","Pseudo-absence points, used as background data due to the impracticality of true absence data for Castanea sativa, were generated using the biomod2 package (R, v4.2-6-2) with the ""disk"" method, enforcing a 10 km minimum distance from presence points for national-scale SDMs across Türkiye (masked to ecologically plausible areas) and a proportional buffer for regional-scale SDMs in the Marmara region. The temporal extent aligned with climatic data: 1970–2000 (WorldClim 2.1) and 1981–2010 (CHELSA 2.1) for baseline, and 2011–2040/2041–2070 for projections, with no explicit temporal buffer. Bias was addressed by thinning presence data (2 km national, 1 km regional) via spThin, applying environmental masking to limit points to suitable areas, and generating 10 replicates of background points (national: 3×400, 3×800, 4×1200; regional: 3×210, 3×420, 4×630) to reduce randomness. Spatial block cross-validation (blockCV, ~140 km² national, ~13.5 km² regional) mitigated autocorrelation. No target group sampling was used; random generation with ecological constraints ensured robustness, with no significant performance differences across quantities."
"Data","Biodiversity data","Errors and biases","Detection probability was not explicitly quantified but mitigated by selecting only mature, dominant stands from forest inventories (OGM, 2016), herbarium records, and 2018–2022 field observations, minimizing false negatives in under-sampled areas. Misidentification potential was reduced by focusing on pure C. sativa stands, though taxonomic confusion with similar species could occur in herbarium records; this was not quantified but assumed minimal due to expert verification. Geo-referencing errors were addressed by cleaning the initial 1,245 presence points to eliminate duplicates and spatial inaccuracies, though minor errors in older herbarium records may persist."

"Data","Data partitioning","Validation data","Validation data for Castanea sativa SDMs were selected using spatial block cross-validation implemented via the blockCV package in R (Valavi et al., 2019), with 25% of the data (presence and pseudo-absence points) withheld from model fitting for testing, ensuring geographically distinct training (75%) and validation sets to reduce spatial autocorrelation bias. Block sizes were determined using the ""cv_spatial_autocor"" function, resulting in minimum ~140 km² blocks (168 km x 215 km sized blocks are used) for national-scale SDMs and  minimum ~13.5 km² blocks (27 km x 51 km sized blocks are used) for regional-scale SDMs. The withheld validation data were used to estimate prediction error via metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistic (TSS), and Boyce Index, with only models achieving TSS > 0.75 included in ensemble modeling to ensure robust model selection and averaging (Section 5). This spatial cross-validation approach enhanced the reliability of performance estimates for model evaluation and ensemble construction."

"Data","Predictor variables","Data processing","Presence data for Castanea sativa (1,245 points from forest inventories, herbarium records, and 2018–2022 field observations) were processed by removing duplicates and applying spatial thinning via the spThin package in R (2 km for national-scale SDMs, 1 km for regional-scale SDMs) to reduce spatial autocorrelation, yielding 393 and 210 points, respectively (Section 3). Pseudo-absence data were generated using the biomod2 package with a 10 km buffer from presence points, constrained within an ecologically plausible mask and produced in 10 replicates (national: 3×400, 3×800, 4×1200; regional: 3×210, 3×420, 4×630) to address spatial uncertainty. Climatic predictors from WorldClim 2.1 and CHELSA 2.1 (1 km resolution) were filtered for multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF < 4) analysis, with no further transformations or normalizations. For regional-scale SDMs, topographic variables (Direct Insolation, Slope, Minimal Curvature, Vertical Distance to Channel Network) from the ASTER GDEM (30 m) were resampled to 120 m using SAGA GIS, and climatic variables were downscaled from 1 km to 120 m via Geographically Weighted Regression to capture microhabitat variability. No thematic aggregations (e.g., land cover classes) were applied. Spatial uncertainties were further addressed through spatial block cross-validation (blockCV, ~140 km² national, ~13.5 km² regional) to ensure geographically distinct training and testing sets. Temporal scaling aligned with baseline (1970–2000 for WorldClim, 1981–2010 for CHELSA) and projection periods (2011–2040, 2041–2070), with no temporal transformations."
"Data","Predictor variables","Errors and biases","Measurement errors and biases in the Castanea sativa SDM data include potential geo-referencing inaccuracies in the 1,245 raw presence points from forest inventories (OGM, 2016), herbarium records, and 2018–2022 field observations, particularly in older herbarium records, though these were mitigated by cleaning duplicates and spatial inaccuracies. Sampling bias was addressed by selecting only mature, dominant stands and applying spatial thinning (2 km for national, 1 km for regional SDMs) using spThin to reduce clustering in oversampled areas like Giresun, Trabzon, and Rize, yielding 393 and 210 points, respectively. Detection bias may exist due to under-sampling in remote areas, potentially missing populations, but was not quantified. Pseudo-absence data, generated via biomod2 with a 10 km buffer, may introduce bias from random placement, mitigated by 10 replicates (national: 3×400, 3×800, 4×1200; regional: 3×210, 3×420, 4×630) and ecological masking. Climatic predictors (WorldClim 2.1, CHELSA 2.1) and topographic variables (ASTER GDEM) may have interpolation errors in complex terrains, addressed by VIF analysis (VIF < 4) and downscaling to 120 m for regional SDMs using Geographically Weighted Regression, though residual errors in rugged areas like the Taurus Mountains remain possible."
"Data","Predictor variables","Dimension reduction","Dimension reduction of the predictor variable set for Castanea sativa SDMs was conducted using non-model-based methods during data preparation. For national-scale SDMs, the initial 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim 2.1 and CHELSA 2.1 (1 km resolution) were filtered for multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis with a threshold of VIF < 4 in the usdm package in R, ensuring predictor independence. For regional-scale SDMs, 38 topographic and hydrological variables derived from the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (30 m, resampled to 120 m) were similarly reduced using VIF analysis (VIF < 4), selecting four variables: Direct Insolation, Slope, Minimal Curvature, and Vertical Distance to Channel Network. Post-VIF, eyeball validations were applied by controlling response curves across modeling algorithms and pseudo-absence sets to ensure ecologically meaningful relationships, retaining only variables with stable, interpretable responses. No additional transformations, normalizations, or thematic aggregations were applied. Model-based variable selection, involving iterative model runs and variable importance analyses, is detailed in the Model section."

"Data","Transfer data","Data processing","Data processing and scaling varied between the national and regional scale models. For the national-scale models, predictor variables from WorldClim 2.1 and CHELSA 2.1 were first filtered for multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), with variables having a VIF > 5 (later < 4) being removed. This resulted in the selection of four key bioclimatic variables for each dataset. For regional-scale models, climatic variables were downscaled from a 1 km to a 120 m resolution using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), while topographic and hydrological variables were resampled to match this resolution. Four relevant variables (Direct Insolation, Slope, Minimal Curvature, and Vertical Distance to Channel Network) were selected, and the climate-only habitat suitability map was integrated as an additional predictor to combine both macro- and micro-environmental gradients."

This analysis highlights areas where future climatic conditions fall outside the range of the training data."
"Model","Variable pre-selection","Variable pre-selection","Pre-selection of variables was conducted differently for national and regional-scale models. For national-scale models, a two-step process was used. First, the 19 bioclimatic variables were screened for multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), with a threshold of VIF < 4. Second, through an iterative process of model runs and variable importance analyses, four key variables were selected for each climate dataset. The final selected variables for WorldClim 2.1 were Temperature Seasonality (bio4), Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (bio10), Annual Precipitation (bio12), and Precipitation Seasonality (bio15). For CHELSA 2.1, the selected variables were Isothermality (chlsa_bio3), Temperature Seasonality (chlsa_bio4), Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (chlsa_bio11), and Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (chlsa_bio19). For the regional-scale models, four topographic and hydrological variables were selected based on low collinearity (VIF < 4) and ecological relevance: Direct Insolation, Slope, Minimal Curvature, and Vertical Distance to Channel Network. The habitat suitability map from the climate-only model was also included as an additional predictor to integrate both macro- and micro-environmental gradients. In all cases, the final selection was also based on the consistent and ecologically meaningful relationships determined by analyzing response curves across different modeling algorithms."

To reduce bias and quantify uncertainty, pseudo-absence points were generated in 10 replicates with varying quantities, and the final ensemble models were constructed by averaging the predictions from all these models. Additionally, spatial cross-validation was performed to provide a more realistic assessment of model performance by mitigating spatial autocorrelation."
"Model","Model estimates","Variable importance","Pre-selection and assessment of variable importance differed between the national-scale and regional-scale models. For the national-scale models, a two-step process was used to select four key variables. First, all 19 bioclimatic variables were screened for multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) (VIF < 4) to ensure independence. Second, an iterative process of model runs and variable importance analyses was used to choose the four most influential variables. For WorldClim 2.1, Annual Precipitation (bio12) was the most important variable with an average importance score of approximately 0.34, followed by Temperature Seasonality (bio4) with 0.25, Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (bio10) with 0.20, and Precipitation Seasonality (bio15) with 0.04. For CHELSA 2.1, Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (chlsa19) was the most influential with an average score of 0.43, with Temperature Seasonality (chlsa4) at 0.30, Mean Temperature of the Driest Quarter (chlsa9) at 0.22, and Isothermality (chlsa3) at 0.10. For the regional-scale hierarchical models, the analysis of variable importance revealed that Slope was by far the most dominant predictor, with an average score of approximately 0.84, with significantly higher importance than the other variables, which included Minimal Curvature at 0.04, Direct Insolation at 0.03, and Vertical Distance to Channel Network (VDCN) at 0.03."
"Model","Model selection - model averaging - ensembles","Model selection","The model selection strategy was based on an ensemble modeling approach to increase prediction robustness and reduce algorithm-specific biases. This involved building individual models using three algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Generalized Boosted Models (GBM), and Generalized Linear Models (GLM). A performance-based filtering step was applied, where only models with a performance score above a minimum threshold (TSS > 0.75) were included in the final ensemble. The final ensemble models were then created by averaging predictions from these selected individual models, which were generated using different pseudo-absence datasets. GBM algorithm was tuned for parameters like the number of trees, interaction depth, and a learning rate (also referred to as shrinkage), while the Random Forest (RF) algorithm's mtry parameter was tuned. For the GLMs, the tuning focused on selecting the optimal combination of variables and interactions."

This approach was implemented to improve predictive accuracy and reduce uncertainty by leveraging the complementary strengths of individual algorithms, like the stability of Random Forest (RF), the flexibility of Generalized Boosted Models (GBM), and the interpretability of Generalized Linear Models (GLM). A performance-based filtering step was also applied, where only models with a TSS score above 0.75 were included in the ensemble, ensuring that low-performing models did not bias the final results. Furthermore, since no substantial differences in evaluation metrics were observed across the pseudo-absence datasets, the final ensemble models were constructed by simply averaging the predictions from all models generated using the different pseudo-absence sets."

This involved creating two distinct models: national-scale models that used broad-scale bioclimatic variables at a 1 km resolution, and regional-scale models that were nested within the national scale. The regional models used a finer 120 m resolution and incorporated local micro-environmental variables (topographic and hydrological) in addition to the habitat suitability map generated by the national-scale model. This hierarchical structure effectively addresses the nested nature of the data by first modeling the influence of broad-scale climate and then refining the predictions with fine-scale local factors."

These steps were conducted in advance as part of the data preparation and analysis workflow. The final ensemble predictions were not subject to these post-processing steps."
"Prediction","Uncertainty quantification","Algorithmic uncertainty","The uncertainty related to the choice of modeling algorithm was addressed by creating a multi-algorithm ensemble. The study built models using three different algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Generalized Boosted Models (GBM), and Generalized Linear Models (GLM). The final predictions were based on the weighted average of the predictions from all three algorithms. This ensemble approach reduces the uncertainty that might arise from relying on a single modeling technique, as it leverages the unique strengths of each algorithm."
"Prediction","Uncertainty quantification","Input data uncertainty","Uncertainty in the location of species occurrence records was accounted for by creating pseudo-absence points for model training. This method helps to balance the skewed nature of presence-only data and reduce the impact of potential sampling biases. Additionally, the study used two different climate datasets, WorldClim 2.1 and CHELSA 2.1, to account for the uncertainty inherent in a single source of environmental data. Finally, the Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface (MESS) analysis was used to identify and quantify areas of novel environmental conditions, effectively addressing the uncertainty of extrapolating model predictions to areas outside the range of the training data."
"Prediction","Uncertainty quantification","Parameter uncertainty","The effect of parameter uncertainty and error propagation was addressed using an ensemble modeling approach. To account for this, the study used BIOMOD_Tuning to calibrate each of the three models, which helped in selecting the optimal set of parameters for each algorithm. Additionally, the study used 10 replicates of pseudo-absence points with varying quantities to build the individual models. The final ensemble predictions were then created by averaging the predictions from all models generated using these different pseudo-absence sets. This method reduces the uncertainty and error that might arise from the random selection of pseudo-absence data and the choice of model parameters, thereby providing a more robust and stable final prediction."
"Prediction","Uncertainty quantification","Scenario uncertainty","The study addresses the uncertainty in future scenarios by using two different climate datasets, WorldClim 2.1 and CHELSA 2.1. By running the models with both of these independent datasets, the study accounts for the uncertainty inherent in relying on a single source of environmental data. The document also uses a set of global circulation models (GCMs) to forecast future conditions under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. This multi-model approach for both environmental data and GCMs helps to quantify the range of possible outcomes and addresses the uncertainty associated with future climate scenarios."
"Prediction","Uncertainty quantification","Novel environments","Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface (MESS) analysis was only performed for an initial plausibility check. The final projections did not undergo masking based on MESS results because the analyses were deemed solid enough to be used across the entire study period."
